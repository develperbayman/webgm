WEBGM PROGRESS

Things to do:

GENERAL
- Fix global and local variables, they should have more properties like being read only, and when you change them things have to happen (e.g. changing 'room' should change the current room).
- Somehow deal with all the collision stuff
- Implement mouse events in Game.js!
- Change project file format to a ZIP file so files like images can be properly stored.
- Maybe make some more realistic Windows like elements, like context menus and floating windows.
- More global game settings
- Compile to HTML
- Expansion packages (wtf?)

SPRITE
