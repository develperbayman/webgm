WEBGM PROGRESS

Things to do:

GENERAL
- Change project file format to a ZIP file so files like images can be properly stored.
- Compile to HTML
- Maybe make some more realistic windows like elements, like context menus and floating windows.
- More global game settings
- Expansion packages (wtf?)
- Libraries: to refer to an action type, you use the name of the library (in GM, you use random ids, but that's garbage come on) and an id for each action type. Currently we just send a reference to the action type object. (also that should be formalized into a class!)
- Implement mouse events in Game.js!
- Somehow deal with all the collision stuff
- Fix global variables, they should have more properties like being read only, and when you change them things have to happen (e.g. chaning 'room' should change the current room).

GML
- Add referencing instances and objects (object.variable)
- Add for statement

SPRITE
- Allow multiple subimages for sprites
	- New HTMLWindowSpriteImages

FONT
- Character range doesn't make sense in the web, however loading a custom font might make sense.

- Parent, mask, object information
- Event key selection menu
- Make buttons disabled when unable to do anything
- Add icons to events, action types, and actions
- Make tabs for libraries
