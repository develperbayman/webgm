# WebGM

Web based version of Game Maker 8.

Live version: https://luizeldorado.github.io/webgm/index.html

## What is this

Game Maker 8 is an old program where you could make Windows games in a simple but powerful way. Many people learned how to program and make games through this software. This project aims to recreate it in a web environment, so that it's free, open, and easy to access. This is mainly for nostalgia purposes, really.

## How to run

Clone it, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), run `npm install` on the folder.

`npm run start` will run it in the browser, `npm run build` will build it in the 'dist' folder. Note that you cannot open the index.html directly, you must create a server for it, using `npx http-server`, for example.
